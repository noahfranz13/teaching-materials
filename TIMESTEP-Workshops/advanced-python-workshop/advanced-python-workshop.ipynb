    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "Neutron stars are ultra-compact astronomical objects that are left remaining after a Core Collapse Supernova occurs. When massive stars are in binaries, multiple neutron stars can be left behind in a binary system. These binary neutron stars spiral around each other and eventually merge. But, because they are so dense, the binary neutron stars emit gravitational waves that we are able to observe with detectors on Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kilonova is the name for the optical light we observe following a binary neutron star merger. Because a binary neutron star merger is a rapid event, we can watch the optical emission following the merger evolve over human time scales. This is called a \"light curve\" and is a plot of the light we see, or \"flux\", as a function of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the directory where this jupyter notebook is I've provided two things that we will use throughout this tutorial:\n",
    "1. A comma-separated file of the light curve of the only known kilonova, called AT2017gfo. This file is called `AT2017gfo-lightcurve.csv`\n",
    "2. A directory of a grid models of kilonova light curves. These models are from [Kasen+17](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05463)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will reproduce the model fitting results of [Kasen+17](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05463) by searching for the best model in the model grid of the AT2017gfo light curve! This will tell us unique properties about the kilonova that are otherwise not measureable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals\n",
    "By the end of going through this jupyter notebook I am hoping that you have built the following skills:\n",
    "1. A better understanding of reading code documentation and applying the functions you find in it\n",
    "2. Improved plotting skills, take some time to make your matplotlib plots pretty!\n",
    "3. How to \"pair code\", or work with a partner to write code\n",
    "4. How to use Astropy Tables and Units (these are super super useful for astronomy!)  \n",
